Recipes
=================

.. currentmodule:: arbor

The :class:`recipe` class documentation is below.

A recipe describes neuron models in a cell-oriented manner and supplies methods to provide cell information.
Details on why Arbor uses recipes and general best practices can be found in :ref:`modelrecipe`.

.. class:: recipe

    Describe a model by describing the cells and network, without any information about how the model is to be represented or executed.

    All recipes derive from this abstract base class.

    Recipes provide a cell-centric interface for describing a model.
    This means that model properties, such as connections, are queried using the global identifier (:attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`) of a cell.
    In the description below, the term ``gid`` is used as shorthand for the cell with global identifier.

    **Required Member Functions**

    The following member functions (besides a constructor) must be implemented by every recipe:

    .. function:: num_cells()

        The number of cells in the model.

    .. function:: cell_kind(gid)

        The cell kind of the cell with global identifier :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid` (return type: :class:`arbor.cell_kind`).

    .. function:: cell_description(gid)

        A high level decription of the cell with global identifier :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`,
        for example the morphology, synapses and ion channels required to build a multi-compartment neuron.
        The type used to describe a cell depends on the kind of the cell.
        The interface for querying the kind and description of a cell are seperate
        to allow the cell type to be provided without building a full cell description,
        which can be very expensive.

    **Optional Member Functions**

    .. function:: connections_on(gid)

        Returns a list of all the **incoming** connections to :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`.
        Each connection should have post-synaptic target ``connection.dest.gid``
        that matches the argument :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`,
        and a valid synapse id ``connection.dest.index`` on :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`.
        See :class:`connection`.

        By default returns an empty list.

    .. function:: gap_junctions_on(gid)

        Returns a list of all the gap junctions connected to :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`.
        Each gap junction ``gj`` should have one of the two gap junction sites ``gj.local.gid``
        or ``gj.peer.gid`` matching the argument :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`,
        and the corresponding synapse id ``gj.local.index`` or ``gj.peer.index`` should be valid on :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`.
        See :class:`gap_junction_connection`.

        By default returns an empty list.

    .. function:: event_generators(gid)

        A list of all the :class:`event_generator` s that are attached to :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`.

        By default returns an empty list.

    .. function:: num_sources(gid)

        The number of spike sources on :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`.

        By default returns 0.

    .. function:: num_targets(gid)

        The number of post-synaptic sites on :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`, which corresponds to the number of synapses.

        By default returns 0.

    .. function:: num_gap_junction_sites(gid)

        Returns the number of gap junction sites on :attr:`arbor.cell_member.gid`.

        By default returns 0.

.. class:: connection

    Describes a connection between two cells:
    Defined by source and destination end points (that is pre-synaptic and post-synaptic respectively),
    a connection weight and a delay time.

    .. function:: connection(source, destination, weight, delay)

        Construct a connection between the :attr:`source` and the :attr:`dest` with a :attr:`weight` and :attr:`delay`.

    .. attribute:: source

        The source end point of the connection (type: :class:`arbor.cell_member`).

    .. attribute:: dest

        The destination end point of the connection (type: :class:`arbor.cell_member`).

    .. attribute:: weight

        The weight delivered to the target synapse.
        The weight is dimensionless, and its interpretation is specific to the type of the synapse target.
        For example, the expsyn synapse interprets it as a conductance with units μS (micro-Siemens).

    .. attribute:: delay

        The delay time of the connection [ms]. Must be positive.

    An example of a connection reads as follows:

    .. container:: example-code

        .. code-block:: python

            import arbor

            # construct a connection between cells (0,0) and (1,0) with weight 0.01 and delay of 10 ms.
            src  = arbor.cell_member(0,0)
            dest = arbor.cell_member(1,0)
            w    = 0.01
            d    = 10
            con  = arbor.connection(src, dest, w, d)

.. class:: gap_junction_connection

    Describes a gap junction between two gap junction sites.
    Gap junction sites are represented by :class:`arbor.cell_member`.

    .. function::gap_junction_connection(local, peer, ggap)

        Construct a gap junction connection between :attr:`local` and :attr:`peer` with conductance :attr:`ggap`.

    .. attribute:: local

        The gap junction site: one half of the gap junction connection.

    .. attribute:: peer

        The gap junction site: other half of the gap junction connection.

    .. attribute:: ggap

        The gap junction conductance [μS].

.. class:: event_generator

    .. function:: event_generator(target, weight, schedule)

        Construct an event generator for a :attr:`target` synapse with :attr:`weight` of the events to deliver based on a schedule (i.e., :class:`arbor.regular_schedule`, :class:`arbor.explicit_schedule`, :class:`arbor.poisson_schedule`).

    .. attribute:: target

        By default returns a schedule with events starting from :attr:`tstart` = 0 ms,
        with an expected frequency :attr:`freq` = 10 Hz and :attr:`seed` = 0.

        # construct an event generator with this schedule on target cell and weight 0.1
        w      = 0.1
        gen    = arbor.event_generator(target, w, sched)

        :param realtime_ratio: Time taken to integrate a cell, for example if ``realtime_ratio`` = 2, a cell will take 2 seconds of CPU time to simulate 1 second.

Below is an example of a recipe construction of a ring network of multi-compartmental cells.
Because the interface for specifying cable morphology cells is under construction, the temporary
helpers in cell_parameters and make_cable_cell for building cells are used.

.. container:: example-code

    .. code-block:: python

            def __init__(self, n=4):
                # The base C++ class constructor must be called first, to ensure that
                # all memory in the C++ class is initialized correctly.
                arbor.recipe.__init__(self)
                self.ncells = n
                self.params = arbor.cell_parameters()

            # must be implemented.

            def cell_description(self, gid):
                return arbor.make_cable_cell(gid, self.params)

            def num_targets(self, gid):
                return 1

            def num_sources(self, gid):

            # The kind method returns the type of cell with gid.
            # Note: this must agree with the type returned by cell_description.
            def cell_kind(self, gid):
                return arbor.cell_kind.cable

            # Make a ring network
            def connections_on(self, gid):
                src = (gid-1)%self.ncells
                w = 0.01
                d = 10
                return [arbor.connection(arbor.cell_member(src,0), arbor.cell_member(gid,0), w, d)]

            def event_generators(self, gid):
                if gid==0:
                    sched = arbor.explicit_schedule([1])
                    return [arbor.event_generator(arbor.cell_member(0,0), 0.1, sched)]
                return []
