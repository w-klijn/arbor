Spike Source Cells
============

This page gives an overview of available spike sources. These are artificial cells generating spikes.
The spikes generated from these cells are typically not generated by neuroscientific model but are  distributed and recorded be recorded as normal spikes. 

The following standard cell operations are NOT possible:
 - Connect samplers to investigate internal state
 - Create synapses and thus connections from other cells

Types:
------
Regular Spiking Source:
    Emits spikes with regular intervals.

Data Spike Source:
    Emits spikes on configured times

Inhomogeneous Poisson Spike Source
    Emits Poisson distributed spikes trains with an time variable rate depending on a configurable function.
