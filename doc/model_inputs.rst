Input to models
============

On this page you find an overview of the different methods available for injecting
input to your models. At the smallest level is possible to inject spikes and currents
directly into a neuron. Arbor also contains set of artificial cells that can generate
spikes: Poisson cells, from a list, regularly spiking or from other simulators (MUSIC).
